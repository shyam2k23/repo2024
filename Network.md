# A Data/Computer Network
- A data network is a system that allows computers and other devices to communicate with each other by transmitting data across a network.
- A data network in a company is a system of connected devices that allows for the sharing and transfer of information
- A computer network is a system of interconnected computing devices that can share data, applications, and other resources.

## Types(Categories) of Networks
- Personal area network, or PAN.
- Local area network, or LAN.
- Metropolitan area network, or MAN.
- Wide area network, or WAN.

## Physical network
Uses cables and other hardware to connect devices. A physical network diagram shows how devices are connected.

## What is Virtual Network?
- Virtual networking is the abstraction of network resources from the underlying physical network infrastructure. A virtual network is the logical representation of the physical hardware, such as the switches and routers, that makes up the infrastructure.
- Virtual Network is other form of logical network where Virtually you will create a network ignoring the physical connections ; best example is VPN
- Uses software to connect devices over the internet. A virtual network is a logical representation of the physical hardware that makes up the network.

- A virtual network (VNet) is a network that uses software to connect devices, servers, and data centers over the internet, instead of physical cables.

## What is a VPN?
A virtual private network (VPN) is a technology that creates a safe and encrypted connection over a less secure network, such as the Internet. A Virtual Private Network is a way to extend a private network using a public network such as the Internet. The name only suggests that it is a “Virtual Private Network”, i.e. user can be part of a local network sitting at a remote location. It makes use of tuneling protocols to establish a secure connection.

## What is VPC?
A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a type of virtual network that provides a private cloud environment within a public cloud.

## What is Amazon VPC?

With Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), you can launch AWS resources in a logically isolated virtual network that you've defined. This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS.

The following diagram shows an example VPC. The VPC has one subnet in each of the Availability Zones in the Region, EC2 instances in each subnet, and an internet gateway to allow communication between the resources in your VPC and the internet.
